Getting Started with Laminar
----------------------------

This is a pre-alpha release of Laminar.

Laminar is a new system that enforces the decentralized information
flow control model. It can enforce fine grained policies, has low overheads and
introduces *security regions* that make it easier to program for security.
More details can be found in our PLDI'09 paper 
"Laminar: Practical Fine-Grained Decentralized Information Flow Control".

The current distribution consists of two patches:
1)laminar-os.patch : The patch has been tested on Linux 2.6.22.6
2)laminar-jvm.patch : The patch has been tested on Jikes 3.0.0

-------------
Compilation:
